    bind0004

    Basic binding functions. Idea was to consolidate binding to reduce redundant code. Proved very cumbersome
    and will be phased out over time.
     
    vTar:       Target entity. See targ0001 function.
    iX, iY, iZ: Location offsets.
    iDir:       Facing and bind set:    0   = No change.
                                        1   = Same as self facing.
                                        -1  = Opposite of self  
                                        2   = Face right 
                                        -2  = Face left.
                                        11  = Release previous bind and delete record of bind.
                                        12  = Release previous bind but store record as if binding normally.
                                        13  = Release previous bind, knock bound entity down to reset it (it may have been stuck 
                                              in a looping animation), and delete record of bind.
    
    iAniFlag:   See http://www.lavalit.com/index.php?topic=963.msg14445#msg14445
