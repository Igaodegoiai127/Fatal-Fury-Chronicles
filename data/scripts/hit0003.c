        Since the defender is an obstacle with MP, then it must be another
        projectile. To simulate projectile priority, we'll use MP as a free variable.
        When two projectiles collide, both must have 2 or more MP, else they will
        both be unaffected. Otherwise the one with lower MP looses 1HP for each point 
        of difference. If MP is equal, both take the equal MP amount as HP damage. 
        
        0 MP = Only true obstacles have 0 MP. 
        1 MP = Intangible and has no effect/does not affect other projectiles.
        2+MP = Compare. If equal, both take the full MP as HP damage. Otherwise, looser
            takes the difference.

        Some examples of how to apply this system:

        1. Flame (I) vs. Knife (II):
            I   = 1MP, 2HP.
            II  = 1MP, 1HP.
            I & II collide. Both have 1MP, so neither takes any damage from the other.

            In Game: A light knife meets a wave of fire, but the fire is immaterial and 
            so they simply pass through each other.

        2. Hadouken (I) vs. Knife (II):
            I   = 2MP, 2HP.
            II  = 3MP, 3HP.
            I & II collide. II has 1 more MP, so I looses the difference (1HP) and is destroyed. II is unaffected.

            In Game: A light knife is no match for the Hadouken and gets
                knocked cleanly aside while the Hadouken continues unscathed.

        3. Hadouken (I) vs. Hadouken (II):
            I   = 3MP, 3HP.
            II  = 3MP, 3HP.
            I & II collide. MP is equal, so both loose 3HP and are destroyed.

            In Game: Classic projectile war. Hadoukens hit and negate each other.

        4. Hadouken (I) vs. Shinku Hadouken (II):
            I   = 3MP, 3HP.
            II  = 3MP, 15HP.
            I & II collide. MP is equal so both loose 3HP. I is destroyed, II continues
                and may withstand 4 more similar collisions.

            In Game: Ryu blasts through several enemy projectils with his Shinku Hadouken. It
                plows over 4 lesser projectiles and negates head to head with a 5th.

        5. Geki Hishoken (I) vs. Hadouken (II):
            I   = 20MP, 1000HP
            II  = 3MP,  3HP
            I & II collide. I has greater MP by 17, so II looses 17HP and is destroyed. I is unaffected.

            In Game: Andy's short range energy attack is effectivly non negatable and easily stops most normal
            projectiles while still hitting anyone nearby.

        6. Geki Hishoken (I) vs. Haohshokoken (II):
            I   = 15MP, 1000HP
            II  = 20MP, 20HP
            I & II collide. II has greater MP by 5, so I looses 5HP. I easily withstands the loss. II is unaffected.
        
            In Game: Ryo's Haohshoken and Andy's Geki Hishoken hit each other with almost no effect. Both
            continue unhindered; Andy is almost certain to be hit, but Ryo could be hit as well if he was 
            close enough to Andy.

        7. Haohshokoken (I) vs. Haohshokoken (II):
            I   = 20MP, 20HP
            II  = 20MP, 20MP
            I & II collide. MP is equal, so both loose 20HP. Both are destroyed.
        
            In Game: One Haohshokoken projectile meets another. While both are capable
            of overpowering and eliminating most other projectiles, they negate each other.
